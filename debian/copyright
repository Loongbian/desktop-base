The  Debian swirl  background  images included  in  this package  were
created by  gfburke@earthlink.net (Gary Burke), and  were derived from
copyright-free   stock   artwork.    It   can   be   downloaded   from
http://wm.themes.org, as "Debian.tar.gz".

The   Debian   "bluedeb"   background   was  created   by   Roger   So
<rogerso@debian.org>, and is under the  terms of the BSD license.  See
../backgrounds/bluedeb.COPYING for more information.

The   Debian   splash   screen   was   created   by   Mirko   Hufnagel
<mirko@abitur97.de>, and is placed into the public domain.

The    Debian_red    splash    screen    imagem   was    created    by
<webanetwork@libero.it>  and is copyright-free.  It can  be downloaded
from http://art.gnome.org/themes/splash_screens/488.php.

The  EvolvingTux splash  screen was  modified by  Filip  Van Raemdonck
<mechanix@debian.org>    based    on    a    GPL   work    found    at

The  debian-security.xcf  file  (and  the resulting  .png  file)  were
created by Colin Walters <walters@debian.org> from the Debian Open Use
Logo and a GNOME icon; both are free software.

The  debian-official-logo-small.png image  is  more or  less a  simple
reformatting of the Debian Official Use Logo.
