The  debian-security.xcf  file  (and  the resulting  .png  file)  were
created by Colin Walters <walters@debian.org> from the Debian Open Use
Logo and a GNOME icon; both are free software.

The  debian-official-logo-small.png image  is  more or  less a  simple
reformatting of the Debian Official Use Logo.

The .desktop  files included  in this package  were compiled  by Colin
Walters <walters@debian.org>.

The gnome-debian-sid "kit" including splash/gnome-debian-sid-splash.xcf.gz, 
splash/gnome-debian-sid-splash.png, wallpapers/gnome-debian-sid-wp.xcf.gz
and wallpapers/gnome-debian-sid-wp.png were made by Josselin Mouette 
<joss@debian.org> and Gustavo Franco <stratus@debian.org>.
